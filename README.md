# word-frequency-exercise

Here I will publish a programming exercise solution for a word frequency problem.

## 1. Functional requirements

The goal of the application is to:
- [ ] 1. Application should be capable of reading N text files (where N is a number, could be 1, 2, 3...) which contain English words.
- [x] 2. It should count the frequency of the words.
- [ ] 3. It should write results into 4 files where words are sorted based on first letter {A-G, H-N, O-U, V-Z).

## 2. Other requirements

- [ ] 1. Technologies and frameworks can be chosed freely.
- [ ] 2. You must use Threads.
- [ ] 3. You must use some existing Java development frameworks.
- [ ] 4. Source code should be clean and readable.
- [ ] 5. You must use good programming practices: using paradigms of object or functional programming, code reuse, simplicity, and other basic programming principles.

## 3. Extra points

- [ ] 1. A web application that has a GUI interface.
- [ ] 2. The file upload mechanism will be used to upload N files.
- [ ] 3. The results will be presented in the web application GUI.
